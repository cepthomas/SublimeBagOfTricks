# If you are going to interact with the current view, use TextCommand,
# otherwise use WindowCommand. Unknown use for ApplicationCommand.
#
# EventListener Class: Note that many of these events are triggered by the buffer underlying the view,
# and thus the method is only called once, with the first view as the parameter.
#
# ViewEventListener Class: A class that provides similar event handling to EventListener, but bound
# to a specific view. Provides class method-based filtering to control what views objects are created for.
