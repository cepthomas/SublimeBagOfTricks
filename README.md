# What It Is
A hodge-podge Sublime Text plugin containing odds and ends missing from or over-developed in other packages.
The focus is not on code development but rather general text processing.

No support as yet for PackageControl.

Built for Windows and ST3. Seems to be happy with ST4. Other OSes and ST2 might require some hacking.

## Signets (bookmarks)
Enhanced bookmarks:
- `Bookmark` and `mark` are already taken so I shall use `signet` which means in French:
> "Petit ruban ou filet qu'on ins√®re entre les feuillets d'un livre pour marquer l'endroit que l'on veut retrouver."
- Persists to sbot-sigs file.
- Next/previous (optionally) traverses files in project - like VS.
- Bookmark key mappings have been stolen:
    - `ctrl+f2`: sbot_toggle_signet
    - `f2`: sbot_next_signet
    - `shift+f2`: sbot_previous_signet
    - `ctrl+shift+f2`: sbot_clear_signets

# Notes

Accumulated notes and discoveries. These pertain to ST3, ST4 may have changed.
- In general, `line` refers to editor lines and is 1-based. `row` refers to buffer contents as an array and is 0-based.
- Project collections, variables, functions, etc use:
  - `persisted` is the json compatible file format.
  - `visual` is the way ST API handles elements.
  - `internal` is the plugin format.
- Commands can't end with `<underscore numeral>` e.g. `my_cmd_1` should be `stpt_cmd1`.
- `package-metadata.json` is used for package management so remove it while developing/debugging plugins because PackageControl
  will delete the entire package.
- If you pass a dict as value in View.settings().set(name, value), it seems that the dict key must be a string.
