# SublimeBagOfTricks
A work-in-progress Sublime Text plugin containing odds and ends missing from other packages.
The focus is not on code development but rather text processing. It's also an excuse to brush up on my python.

Built for Windows and ST3 but most should work for other OSes and ST2.

## Features
- Simple render to html with styles for printing.
- Word colorizing.
- Popup scopes in their color scheme settings.
- Close window if file is deleted.
- Enhanced bookmarks: Persistence, next/prev across files.
- New bookmarks. `Bookmark` and `mark` are already taken so I shall use `signet` which means in French:
```
"Petit ruban ou filet qu'on ins√®re entre les feuillets d'un livre pour marquer l'endroit que l'on veut retrouver."
```
- More to come...
